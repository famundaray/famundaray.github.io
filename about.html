After graduating from graphic design i moved to Miami to persue my dreams and now I'm studiying Advertising in Miami International Univeristy of Art and Design and i'm exploring in all the area posible. Also I love Fashion so probable my next move will involve sometime about it, I can't wait too see what the future holds for me!
